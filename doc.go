/*
GEMU is the DCPU emulator that powers Tech Compliant.
In order to allow DCPU developers to write software targeting our DCPU systems easier, we are open sourcing the core of our emulator, as well as a few small utilities to allow it to be used directly, without requiring developers to build their own tools around our emulator.
